# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project

For this project we needed to adjust the initial website we made to include all four of Mars' hemisphere images. We used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres and the titles of those images. Then we stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, and used a web application to display the data. Finally, we altered the design of the web app to accommodate the images.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a web application to display the four images and titles we scraped.
